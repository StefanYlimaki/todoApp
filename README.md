In this todo-app I test React Native.

Unfortunately, the application cannot yet be used publicly, since there are no user handling. Everyone would see eachother's todos. So it's only for my personal use :)

However, I can tell you how it works. It is pretty simple.

The server:
runs in the internet, hosted by Vercel.
has endpoints for getting, adding and deleting todos.
todos are saved in a MongoDB database

The client:
can be downloaded via expo go app, by scanning a QR-code
works on Android and on iOS
user can see, add or delete todos via the application UI.
